*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

Extract the download archive directly into your MCP-directiory.
It should create a folder "tfcraft" within that directory, containing all 
extracted files.

You should use freshly downloaded jars, solely including ModLoader in the 
client jar. Anything else can eventually cause conflicts.

Now install Forge.

Next just start the install.cmd/.sh, TFCraft will install itself into the proper
locations and copy all needed files, as well as modifying the needed baseclasses.

The install scripts should take care of everything for you, so you should only need to 
install forge before you install TFCraft.
